# Environment Setup for Intel Extension for PyTorch

This repository contains a project that leverages Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) to optimize the performance of PyTorch models on Intel hardware. Below are the steps to set up the environment for running this project.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the environment, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: Python 3.6 or newer.
- **PyTorch**: Version 1.12.0 or newer is recommended.
- **Intel CPU or GPU**: For maximum performance, an Intel Xeon CPU or Intel GPU (Xe, Iris) is recommended.

## Installation
